# TypeScript HTML Application Template for Visual Studio 2017
A template for new projects in Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019 that creates an HTML application with TypeScript.

This is the same template that that used to be in Visual Studio 2015.  The Visual Studio team removed it in Visual Studio 2017.  It will appear under 'TypeScript' under 'Other Languages' assuming the correct dependencies are installed.

The built template can be installed from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Rich-Newman.TypeScriptHTMLApplicationTemplate), or from within Visual Studio 2017.  Search for 'TypeScript HTML Application Template'.
