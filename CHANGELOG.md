# Changelog

These are the changes to each version that have been released
on the official Visual Studio extension gallery.

## 2.1

**2021-03-24**

- Uses latest available version of TypeScript, rather than using 2.1 and asking for an upgrade every time
- Better descriptions, making it clearer what this is.  Previous descriptions referred prominently to Visual Studio 2015, which doesn't make much sense in 2021.
- Update code so it lints with TypeScript Analyzer.

## 2.0

**2019-06-01**

- Make available in Visual Studio 2019

## 1.0

**2017-05-09**
